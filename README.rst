Easy_dna is a Python library implementing useful routines for manipulating DNA
sequences, either as "ATGC" strings or Biopython records. It aims at providing
a simpler interface than Biopython for common operations related to DNA sequence
design and genbank generation.

Easy_dna was originally created to gather useful methods repeatedly used in the
different software projects of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry for DNA design and
manufacturing. 

See the API reference `here <https://edinburgh-genome-foundry.github.io/easy_dna/>`_.
